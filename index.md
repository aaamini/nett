# nett 


`nett` is an R package for the analysis of network data with a focus on **community detection** and associated models.

Check out the articles for some examples of how to use the package.

The package is under development and hopefully more features will be added as time goes by.

## Installation
The package is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/aaamini/nett/). To install, you can use the following command

<pre>
devtools::install_github("aaamini/nett")
</pre>

To also build the vignettes when installing use the follwing:

<pre>
devtools::install_github("aaamini/nett", build_vignettes = TRUE)
</pre>

This will take some time. Alternatively, just refer to the articles on this website (which are the the built vignettes).
